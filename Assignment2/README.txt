This is my submission for CS 426 Assignment 2

There is a make file that compiles everything.

"make" should compile all the executables
"make clean" removes the executables

2 executables are made via the makefile "p420" and "p421".

There is no executable created for p320.c because there is no main since it's an API per Dr. Hongs instructions

p420 requires no arguments and as per instructions it creates 100 threads and then releases them.

p421 requires user input after a prompt

None of the program require command line inputs
